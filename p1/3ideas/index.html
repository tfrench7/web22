      <h1>Three Ideas</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
      <h2>#1:Funko Pops</h2>
      <p>
        1.For my first idea I’m a collector of funko pop figures which is a company that creates nostalgia themed bobbleheads. The first item the company ever created was the Big Boy bobblehead. I would like to go in depth on how they come up with the idea and history overall. I think making the hierarchy of the website would be fun because of the colors of the company.
        </p>
      <h2>#2:Strawberry</h2>
      <p>
        2.For my second idea I was thinking of something simpler like my favorite fruit strawberry. I would do different fun facts about the fruit like the origin of the name. I also talk about how strawberries are used in cuisines; I’ll talk about different recipes on websites. The strawberry is a member of the rose family, with the most common varieties being a hybrid of the wild Virginia strawberry and a Chilean variety.

      <h2>#3:T-shirt making history</h2>
      <p>
        3.For my third idea I want to do something about the history of T-shirt making. This is a passion I want to do after getting out of school. The origins of the t-shirt date back to the late 19th century when laborers would cut their jumpsuits in half to keep cool in warmer months during the year. The first manufactured t-shirt was invented between the Mexican American war in 1898, and 1913 when the U.S. Navy began issuing them as standard undershirts.
